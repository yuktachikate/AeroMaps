## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 17.0 or later
- macOS 14.0 or later (for development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AeroMaps
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open AeroMaps.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Build and Run**
   - Select your target device or simulator
   - Press `Cmd+R` to build and run

### Configuration

The app includes several configuration options:

- **Location Services**: The app requests location permission to show your position on the map
- **Airport Database**: Currently includes major California airports (KSFO, KSJC, KRNO, KSQL, KOAK)
- **Weather Data**: Simulated weather data for demonstration purposes

## Usage Guide

### Basic Navigation
1. **Search for airports** using the search bar (e.g., "KSFO", "KSJC")
2. **Tap the map** to add waypoints
3. **Use the bottom sheet** to view route information
4. **Toggle layers** using the layer controls

### Flight Planning
1. **Create a route** by searching or tapping waypoints
2. **Adjust altitude and speed** using the controls in the bottom sheet
3. **View performance data** including fuel requirements
4. **Check weight & balance** for your aircraft

### Weather Information
1. **Access weather panel** through the weather layer
2. **View METAR data** for airports
3. **Check forecasts** and winds aloft
4. **Monitor radar** and satellite imagery

## FFM: Risk-Aware Planning (Field Foundation Model)

Enhances planning with risk-aware route predictions, risk heatmaps, and real-time advisory messages.

### What it adds
- **FFM Plan button** in the bottom sheet triggers risk-aware planning
- **Risk overlays** via `MKTileOverlay` heatmaps (toggle the "FFM Risk" layer)
- **Advisory text** summarizing hazards and recommendations
- **Per-leg risks** (icing, turbulence, terrain)
- **Computed route polyline** when returned by the backend

### Configuration
- `AeroMaps/Info.plist` keys:
  - `FFMBaseURL` (string): base URL of the FFM backend, e.g. `https://api.yourdomain.com`
  - `FFMUseMock` (bool): set `true` to use bundled mock response

### How to use in the app
1. Add at least two waypoints (search or tap the map)
2. Tap "FFM Plan" in the bottom sheet
3. Toggle the "FFM Risk" layer in Layer Controls to show the heatmap
4. Read advisory and per-leg risks in the bottom sheet

### Mock mode (no server required)
- Set `FFMUseMock` to `true` in `Info.plist` and rebuild, or
- Change `computeFFMPlan()` to call `client.plan(request:useMock: true)` during development
- The bundled `AeroMaps/ffm_mock_response.json` powers the mock visuals

### Backend API (expected contract)
- Endpoint: `POST {FFMBaseURL}/v1/plan`
- Request body example:
  ```json
  {
    "aircraft": {"type": "GA", "trueAirspeedKTAS": 140, "fuelBurnGPH": 9.5},
    "route": [{"lat": 37.6213, "lon": -122.3790}, {"lat": 37.3639, "lon": -121.9289}],
    "policy": {"reserveMinutes": 45, "enforceMEF": true}
  }
  ```
- Response body example:
  ```json
  {
    "polyline": [{"lat": 37.6213, "lon": -122.3790}, {"lat": 37.3639, "lon": -121.9289}],
    "legRisks": [{"fromIndex": 0, "toIndex": 1, "icing": 0.2, "turbulence": 0.4, "terrain": 0.1}],
    "alternates": ["KOAK", "KSQL"],
    "advisory": "Moderate turbulence forecast along the route.",
    "riskTileTemplates": ["https://tiles.example.com/heat/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?token=..."]
  }
  ```

### Safety envelope applied client-side
- Reserve time enforced ‚â• 45 minutes
- Altitudes clamped to a basic MEF-like floor
- TAS and fuel burn clamped to reasonable aircraft performance ranges

### Create a short FFM demo GIF (optional)
1. Record a brief simulator clip (10‚Äì15s):
   ```bash
   xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo --codec h264 /tmp/ffm_demo.mov &
   REC_PID=$!
   # Manually in the simulator: add 2 waypoints ‚Üí tap "FFM Plan" ‚Üí toggle "FFM Risk"
   sleep 15 && kill $REC_PID
   ```
2. Convert to GIF (requires ffmpeg):
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -y -i /tmp/ffm_demo.mov -vf "fps=15,scale=800:-1:flags=lanczos,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse" media/ffm_demo.gif
   ```
3. Embed in README:
   ```markdown
   ![FFM Demo](media/ffm_demo.gif)
   ```

## Key Components

### MapState
Central state management for the app, handling:
- Map camera position and style
- Route planning and waypoints
- Layer visibility
- Flight mode

### LocationManager
Handles GPS and location services:
- Location authorization
- GPS updates
- Heading information

### WeatherService
Manages weather data:
- METAR/TAF information
- Weather data caching
- Airport weather lookup

## Customization

### Adding Airports
To add more airports, modify the `airports` dictionary in `MapState`:

```swift
let airports: [String: Airport] = [
    "KXXX": Airport(
        icao: "KXXX",
        name: "Your Airport",
        city: "Your City",
        state: "ST",
        coordinate: .init(latitude: 0.0, longitude: 0.0),
        elevation: 0,
        runways: [...],
        frequencies: [...],
        services: [...]
    )
]
```

### Adding Aircraft
To add more aircraft types, modify the `aircraft` array in `FlightPlannerView`:

```swift
let aircraft = [
    ("KXXX", "Your Aircraft", 120, 8.5),
    // Add more aircraft here
]
```

### Customizing UI
The app uses a consistent design system with:
- **Colors**: Defined in `LayerKind` and `FlightMode` enums
- **Typography**: System fonts with semantic sizing
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins
- **Effects**: Glass morphism and shadows

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Network layer** for API calls
- **Unit tests** for calculations
- **Performance optimization** for large datasets
- **Accessibility** improvements
